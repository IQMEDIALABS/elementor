## Testing Frameworks

We use framework for unit tests, and {framework} for our end-to-end tests.

## Running Tests Locally

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests:

`yarn test`

游릴 3        "email": "hello@cypress.io",
游릴 4        "body": "Fixtures are a great way to mock data for responses to routes"

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {path for a test file} tests the {feature's name} feature.

{Add specific best practices you would like to share}
