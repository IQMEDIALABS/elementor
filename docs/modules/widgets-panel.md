## Widgets Panel Guideline

This widget lets the user add widgets to the “FAVORITES” category in the editor panel. 
It was created to save user time and to make the interface more user friendly. 
Now Instead search the widget each time he wants to add him to preview, he just needs to add the widget to “FAVORITES” and drag it to preview from there.

### How To Add Widget To “FAVORITES” Category
Wow it’s so easy, just right click on the widget you want to add and see the button “Add To Favorites” just click on this and that's all.

### How To Remove Widget From “FAVORITES” Category
Right click on the widget under “FAVORITES” category and see the button “Remove From Favorites” just click on this and that's all.

### Why I Can’t See The “FAVORITES” Category In Editor Panel
Because the logic of panel categories said, if there is no widgets under category - don’t display this category. That means if you didn’t add a minimum one widget to the “FAVORITES” category you can’t see the “FAVORITES” category. Same logic happens when you remove all widgets from “FAVORITES” category.

### Known issues / attention needed
Right now it's not possible to add widget type section to "FAVORITES" category.

For example : "Inner Section" widget.
